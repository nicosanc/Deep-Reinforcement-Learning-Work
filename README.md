# Foundations-of-Deep-RL-Implementations
As a way of deepening my understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning, I am reading through the textbook
Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Practice in Python by Laura Graesser and Wah Loon Keng. 
The textbook covers several major algorithms used in Deep RL including Reinforce, SARSA, DQN, and PPO. As I study the theory behind 
these different algorithms and their pros and cons, I also am implementing the algorithms following the steps shown by the authors. 
The plan is to collect enough experience building these projects that I'll be able to implement them on my own with enough understanding
of the frequently used libraries and frameworks.
